# Personal Portfolio Site 🚀

Built with Astro and Tailwind, this is my corner of the internet where I showcase what I do best - making IT departments run smoother than a well-oiled machine.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Astro for that sweet static site performance
- Tailwind CSS because life's too short for vanilla CSS
- Preact for interactive bits

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start
```bash
npm install    # Get your dependencies
npm run dev    # Fire up localhost:3000
```

## 📝 Todo List
- [ ] Fix badge contrast (text's playing hide and seek in dark mode)
- [ ] Add proper tech stack icons
- [ ] Build out project showcases
- [ ] Add contact form
- [ ] SEO optimization
