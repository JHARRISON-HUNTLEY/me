title: "Your Pretty UI is Costing Millions"

Watch someone Alt+Tab through their workspace. Now watch someone Win+Tab. One's already checked four windows while the other's admiring their desktop animations. It's not just about the pretty transitions - it's about time. 

Let's do the math: 0.3 seconds versus 1.2 seconds per switch. With 200 switches a day, that's 3 minutes daily watching pretty animations. 15 minutes a week. An hour every month. Twelve hours a year - an entire half-day spent admiring Windows' transition effects.

That's £420 per person annually spent on pretty animations. For a team of 100? You're burning £42,000 a year on eye candy.

## The Tool Evaluation Meeting

Want to see where millions get burned? Sit in on any enterprise tool evaluation:

```
STAKEHOLDER MEETING - NEW TOOL EVALUATION
UX: "The interface is stunning"
Security: "The authentication is concerning"
Finance: "The pricing is..."
IT: *already drafting the integration plan*
```

Spoiler: We bought it. The interface really was stunning.

## The SaaS Sprawl Reality

The average enterprise in 2024 runs 300+ SaaS tools. Every "easy" tool comes with a hidden tax:
- Another vendor to manage
- Another security review
- Another set of credentials
- Another training session
- Another integration to maintain
- Another renewal negotiation

Suddenly that "easy" button costs £50k/year and three FTEs. Your "user-friendly" tool just became a full-time job.

## The Efficiency Paradox

Watch a vim user navigate a codebase while your coworker is still clicking through VS Code's file explorer. The hard way often becomes the easy way. The easy way stays... just easy enough to be mediocre.

```javascript
// "Easy" way: Click through 6 screens to reset a password
// Efficient way:
await resetUserPassword({
  userId: "jsmith",
  notifyUser: true,
  auditLog: true
});
// One line, consistent, logged, done.
```

## The Nuanced Take

But here's where it gets interesting. Good efficiency isn't about being harder - it's about being precise. The best tools grow with you: easy to start, powerful to master. Your tools should have a skill ceiling higher than your ambitions.

Real efficiency often leads to elegance:
- PowerShell looks scary until you automate your entire infrastructure
- Git feels complex until you need to rollback that 3 AM "quick fix"
- Regex seems cryptic until you need to find that one config line across 400 servers

## The Bottom Line

When evaluating tools because they're "user-friendly," ask: Friendly to whom? The first-time user or the power user? The marketing team or the maintenance team? Your quick demo or your quarterly security audit?

True efficiency isn't about making things harder - it's about balance. End-user experience is crucial; a tool that nobody can use is just as wasteful as one that prioritizes polish over performance. The sweet spot? Tools that offer both an accessible entry point and the depth for power users to excel.

That's the balance we're after: tools that are accessible enough for daily tasks, but powerful enough for when things get real. Because in enterprise IT, we need both - a UI that your team can navigate confidently, and the powerful features to get the job done precisely.

And for the record, I wrote this entire post in vim. No mice were disturbed in the making of this manifesto.
